# Data Packages

Data packages are a sfpowerscripts construct that utilise the [SFDMU plugin](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SFDX-Data-Move-Utility) to create a versioned artifact of Salesforce object records in csv format, which can be deployed to the a Salesforce org using the sfpowerscripts package release command.

The Data Package offers a seamless method of integrating Salesforce data into your CI/CD pipelines, and is primarily intended for record-based configuration of managed package such as CPQ, Vlocity \(Salesforce Industries\), and nCino.
